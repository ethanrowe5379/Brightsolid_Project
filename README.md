Brian: 

Having notes early on will allow you to talk about this in the reports. 

For meeting on Monday, you have 20 min so you can show what you have including GitHub, how you’ve planned the project and prioritised user stories and any questions. 

Any issues should be addressed internally but we are here if anything needs to be addressed.  

Time is crucial so the leader will have to monitor peoples progress and then update us during the leader meetings. 

Ethan: 
  - So far I've been working on converting the brief into the user stories and tasks with Jamie. 

DJ: 
	- Yesterday I worked on the start of the UX designs – we decided to use bootstrap so this 		should convert between tablet computer and phone easily so long as we keep it in mind.

Brain:A 

  -the plan is up to you, we advise you to not wait until the third week to write the report. Do 	work now rather than later.  Having a plan that will look ahead to not only Monday but further.
